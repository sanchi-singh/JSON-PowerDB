TITLE- WEB PROJECT FORM VALIDATION
DESCRIPTION- FORM VALIDATION 
BENEFITS -1)JSON is self-describing, which allows applications to easily manipulate JSON data. Application objects are rich and can be easily represented in JSON format whether sparse, hierarchical, or deeply nested.
          2)JSON is simple and compact, facilitating easy data transfer across platforms, and among a wide range of users. Part of JSONâ€™s widening appeal with developers is due to the fact that it is easy to learn, read and understand.
          3)JSON is dynamically typed. It contains no fixed data type and the attributes can vary across different documents.
